### Hi there! 👋

I am Jordana! In my career, I have been participating in several projects (in the areas of financial services, telecommunications, agribusiness, among others) in which I use Big Data and Analytics technologies, working mainly with engineering and data analysis. In this way, I was able to become familiar with the AWS environment (Redshift, S3, EC2, EMR, DynamoDB and Cloud9) and with agile design methodologies (Scrum) and Kanban, in addition to common work practices at startups. Graduating in Information Systems at USP, I am interested and seek to delve into topics related to Big Data architecture, data engineering and data science.
